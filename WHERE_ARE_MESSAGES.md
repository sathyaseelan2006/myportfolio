## Method 3: Your Backend Server

### 📧 Where Messages Are Stored:
**JSON files on your server**

### 💾 Storage Locations:

#### **Contact Form Submissions:**
**File:** `server/data/contact-submissions.json`
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1698432000000",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-27T15:40:00.000Z",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "subject": "Project Inquiry",
    "message": "Hi, I'd like to discuss a project..."
  }
]
```

#### **Project Request Submissions:**
**File:** `server/data/project-requests.json`
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1698432100000",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-27T15:41:00.000Z",
    "projectName": "E-commerce Website",
    "projectType": "web-development",
    "projectDescription": "Need a full e-commerce site...",
    "budget": "$5000-$10000",
    "timeline": "3 months"
  }
]
```

### 📖 How to Read Messages:

#### **Option 1: Open the JSON files directly**
1. Go to `server/data/` folder
2. Open `contact-submissions.json` in any text editor
3. See all messages!

#### **Option 2: Use the Admin API**
1. Make sure server is running: `cd server && npm start`
2. Open browser and go to:
   - Contact messages: http://localhost:5000/api/admin/contact
   - Project requests: http://localhost:5000/api/admin/project
3. You'll see nicely formatted JSON

#### **Option 3: Create an Admin Dashboard** (I can help with this!)
- Web interface to view messages
- Search and filter
- Mark as read/unread
- Reply functionality

### ✅ Advantages:
- Full control over data
- No third-party dependencies
- Can add features (reply, archive, etc.)
- Free forever
- Privacy - your data stays with you

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- No automatic email notifications (but we can add this!)
- Need to check manually or build dashboard
- Need to keep server running

## 🔔 Setting Up Email Notifications for Backend

Want emails even with the backend? Add this to your server!

### Install Nodemailer:
```bash
cd server
npm install nodemailer
```

### Update `server/index.js`:
```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Create email transporter
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your-app-password' // Generate in Gmail settings
  }
});

// In the /api/contact route, add this after saving:
app.post('/api/contact', async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, subject, message } = req.body || {};
  
  if (!name || !email || !subject || !message) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });
  }
  
  // Save to file
  appendToFile(contactFile, { name, email, subject, message });
  
  // Send email notification to yourself!
  try {
    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: email,
      to: 'ksathyaseelan34@gmail.com', // YOUR email
      subject: `Portfolio Contact: ${subject}`,
      text: `
New contact form submission!

From: ${name} (${email})
Subject: ${subject}

Message:
${message}
      `
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Email error:', error);
  }
  
  return res.json({ ok: true });
});
```

Now you'll get emails PLUS have them saved in files! Best of both worlds! 🎉
